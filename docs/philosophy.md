# Philosophy

SelfLauncher is built on the principle that software should not dictate how it is used.

Instead of providing a predefined set of features, SelfLauncher offers a neutral foundation. The core is intentionally minimal and avoids implementing behavior that can be defined externally. This ensures flexibility, adaptability, and long-term extensibility.

Configuration is treated as a first-class component. Behavior is not hardcoded into the executable and does not require recompilation. Users define what the launcher does, how it behaves, and how it looks through external files and modules.

SelfLauncher does not attempt to be a universal solution. It is a system for building solutions. Different users can create completely different launchers using the same core, without modifying it.

The project prioritizes control, transparency, and composability over convenience and opinionated design.
