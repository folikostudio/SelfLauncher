# SelfLauncher

SelfLauncher is a modular and user-driven launcher platform designed to execute arbitrary actions defined entirely by configuration and extensions.

It is not a pre-built launcher with fixed behavior. Instead, it provides a minimal runtime that loads configuration, discovers external modules, and executes named commands. Everything else — logic, behavior, interface, and purpose — is defined by the user.

SelfLauncher can be used as a game launcher, a development toolbox, an application hub, or a custom execution environment. Its role is determined not by the executable itself, but by how it is configured and extended.

The core idea of SelfLauncher is simple:  
**the executable does almost nothing — the user decides everything.**
