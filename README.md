# SelfLauncher

SelfLauncher is a modular, configuration-driven launcher platform.

It provides a minimal executable that loads configuration and extensions, then executes named commands defined by the user. The project does not enforce specific workflows or interfaces.

SelfLauncher can be adapted for many purposes, including application launchers, development tools, automation hubs, or custom execution environments.

## Key Ideas

- Minimal core
- Command-based execution
- Fully user-defined behavior
- External extensions
- Interface as a separate layer

SelfLauncher is not a product — it is a foundation.
